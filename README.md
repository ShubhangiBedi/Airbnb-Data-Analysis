# Airbnb Data Analysis
**Project Overview ðŸ“Š**
This project, "Airbnb Data Analysis Using Tableau," aims to analyze Airbnb listings to identify key market trends, pricing patterns, and occupancy rates. By evaluating factors such as total listings, average price, availability, and review scores, the study provides actionable insights for hosts, investors, and market analysts. The analysis helps with optimizing pricing, identifying high-demand locations, and understanding seasonal trends for data-driven decision-making in the short-term rental market.



**Key Findings ðŸ”Ž**

1. Market Size: The analysis of 69,305 total listings shows a substantial market with a wide variety of options available.
2. Pricing: The average price for a listing is $624.74, which suggests the platform may be targeting a more affluent demographic due to the high cost of living in the area.
3. Availability: A high average availability of 153.2 days could indicate an oversupply of listings or underutilized properties.
4. Review Scores: The average review score is 3.322 out of 5, signaling potential customer dissatisfaction with service quality, pricing, or property conditions.
5. Room Type Preference: Entire homes or apartments are the most popular room type, accounting for 54% of listings, which suggests guests prioritize privacy or the ability
   to accommodate larger groups.
6. Geographic Performance: Prices vary significantly by location. Manhattan has the highest average price, which is expected for a premium location. Areas like Grand
   Street, New Dorp, and Fulton Street show strong occupancy and pricing resilience, making them ideal for new listings.
7. Occupancy Trends: There's a steady increase in bookings from Q1 to Q4, with a peak in the fourth quarter, likely due to seasonal and holiday travel.

**Recommendations for Stakeholders ðŸ’¡**
- Market Opportunities: Use geo-targeted ads to attract more travelers and implement seasonal pricing strategies to boost demand during off-peak times.
- Room Type Strategy: To attract budget travelers, increase the visibility of private rooms and offer discounts on shared rooms to boost occupancy.
- Host Engagement: Strengthen the review and rating system to increase transparency. Reward top-performing hosts, like Michael, David, and Alex, with better search rankings   and lower fees to encourage high-quality listings.
